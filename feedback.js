// Project works, smooth and very good job with login/register/logout. I love the waiting spinner. 
// You used middleware, built very good full stack project which is amazing! 
// Thank you for using external db - not only does it make your project really full stack, but it is also very easy to access and therefore your db is more stable. 
// I like that you use .env and .gitignore, these are very important details. 
// I don't have much to say about your code, it's a great job!
// I like that you give me instructions on what your application can do. 

// As an improvement, I wish you would give me a chance to change my income. Now I guess I have to create a new user with a new income? Also, I would like to see your main table on the home page, because this is basically the main thing I need in the app, right? Also look at the styles, sometimes they "jump". 

// Overall great project guys!
